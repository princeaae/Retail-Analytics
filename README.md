## ðŸ”„ Steps Followed

1. **Uploaded dataset to BigQuery** and ran basic SQL queries to understand schema
2. **Connected BigQuery to Power BI** and loaded the dataset
3. Cleaned and transformed data using **Power Query**:
   - Fixed headers
   - Converted text columns to proper data types (e.g., dates, decimals)
   - Handled missing values in Sales Price
4. Created custom logic to estimate **missing Marked Prices**:
   - Added a `Factor` column:  
     `= IF(Original Price is blank, 1.5, 0)`
   - Created a new column:  
     `= Sales Price * Factor`
   - Used this to fill missing Marked Prices
5. Removed temporary columns after transformation

## ðŸ§® Key DAX Calculations

```DAX
-- Profit %
Profit % = RANDBETWEEN(2, 17)

-- Cost Price
Cost Price = DIVIDE(100 * [Sales Price], 100 + [Profit %])

-- Discount %
Discount % = DIVIDE([Marked Price] - [Sales Price], [Marked Price]) * 100
